### Tower Defense Game Project - Winter 2024

**Project Overview:**

**Step 1: Skeleton Setup**
- Create classes `Tile` and abstract class `Insect`.
- Implement subclasses of `Insect`:
  - `Hornet`
  - Abstract class `HoneyBee`
    - `BusyBee`
    - `AngryBee`

**Step 2: Setting Up Main Data Structures**
- Implement `SwarmOfHornets` class representing a group of hornets.
- Enhance `Tile` class with necessary fields and methods.

**Step 3: Basic Game Mechanics**
- Implement action methods and overrides in `Insect`, `Hornet`, `HoneyBee`, `BusyBee`, and `AngryBee` classes.

**Step 4: Introducing Special Units**
- Introduce Fire Bees and Sniper Bees to enhance gameplay mechanics.
- Implement necessary fields and methods in existing classes to accommodate the new special units.

**Conclusion:**
This project provides practical experience in class design and coding, preparing developers for building more complex games and applications. The focus on critical thinking and optimization fosters a deeper understanding of software development principles.
